# Weather App

This app is a weather app that uses the OpenWeather API to provide weather information for a specific geographical location. The app has a search bar that allows users to enter a city name. 

When a user enters a city name, the app will fetch weather information from the OpenWeather API and display it on the screen. The weather information includes the following:

- Weather condition
- Current temperature
- Name of the City
- Day and date
- Minimum temperature
- Maximum temperature
- Humidity
- Wind speed


The app also has a feature that allows the background image to reflect the type of weather condition. For example, if the weather condition is sunny, the background image will be a picture of a sunny day. If the weather condition is cloudy, the background image will be a picture of a cloudy day.
